            Main focus of the company is their Simsar application that has 100+ customers. Main focus of the application is
            managing companies in all aspects. Product stock management, product pricing management, cashbox, product
            category system, profit tracking, product selling statistics, current administration, accounting, personnel
            management, can be integrated with Trendyol, Hepsiburada and many other e-commerce platforms plus many other
            things all in one software. I worked as a front-end software developer for 5 years. Frontend of the Simsar is
            made with WPF. I made a mobile supported web interface for the Simsar backend and then primarily focused on
            developing a custom content management system (CMS) tailored to client needs. I also provided support about
            proper Simsar application usage for our customers.

                <b>Objective:</b> Rewriting the legacy Simsar project using modern software tools and libraries to achieve cross-platform
                compatibility, with the web as the primary platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Overview:</b> Addressed core design flaws from the original Simsar system while retaining its key principles.
                Collaborated with the original Simsar designers and maintainers for insights and best practices. Focused on implementing
                a modern, scalable, and efficient frontend architecture.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>My Contributions:</b>
                Designed and developed the entire frontend for the application, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience.
                Built a frontend server to support Server-Side Rendering (SSR). Implemented an authentication proxy from my SSR
                server to main .NET server. Stored and managed the session data by using SQLite. Leveraged OpenAPI for automated
                TypeScript code generation, enabling dynamic updates to the frontend whenever server endpoints changed. Optimized
                data fetching and caching to minimize unnecessary server requests and enhance performance.
